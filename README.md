# Analysis of mobile signal strength - Team B Internship Project


## Project Description
The aim of this project is to analyze mobile signal strength data to gain insights into user experience and to provide suggestions to optimize telecommunications network
The project will involve analyzing large datasets of mobile signal strength measurements, collected from an ExploreAI proprietary tool. 
The project should investigate machine learning algorithms to predict signal strength at different locations. 
The insights gained from this analysis will be used to optimize the placement of mobile towers and to improve network performance.


## Deliverables
- Overall
  - [ ] A report summarizing the findings of the analysis and recommendations for network planning, optimization and customer experience.  The report should demonstrate a clear understanding of the mobile telecoms domain
  - [ ] A dashboard for visualizing signal strength data, providing insights into signal strength and customer experience
  - [ ] A dashboard for visualizing signal strength data, providing insights into signal strength and customer experience
        
- Data Engineering
  - [ ] Description of the data sources and data dictionary
  - [ ] Data cleaning and preparation pipelines
  - [ ] Data model for the data, using in domain driven design principles
        
- Data Science
  - [ ] Exploratory Data Analysis to show understanding of the problem landscape
  - [ ] Insightful visualizations of signal strength data
  - [ ] Analysis of signal strength trends by location and time


## Contextual information
ExploreAI has a well established Telco Practice, building AI use cases optimising decisions across the following elements of the value chain:
- Network planning and design
- Network optimisation
- Customer monetisation

  This data in this project is specifically focussed on gathering real-time network customer experience data - measured through signal strength. We can use this data to provide a ground truth against predicted signal strength using physics based ray-tracing models.
